            </p><h2>Geographical Data</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The Netherlands is a very flat country with almost 25% of its land at, or below sea level. The country covers a
                total area of 41,865 sq. km. Low rolling hills cover some of the central areas, and in the far south, the land rises
                into the foothills of the Ardennes Mountains. Vaalserberg, the country's highest point is located there, rising to
                322 m (1,053 ft).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Netherlands is crossed by hundreds of miles of navigable canals. One of the most important is the North Sea
                Canal, as it enables ocean-going ships to reach the port of Amsterdam. Water, water everywhere, as the central
                and southern Netherlands are positioned at the delta of four major rivers, including the Rijn, Mass, Scheldt and
                Waal.

            </p><h2>History</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The Netherlands has been a <b>constitutional monarchy</b> since 1815, and due to the efforts of Johan Rudolph
            Thorbecke became a parliamentary democracy in 1848. The Netherlands is described as a consociational state.
            Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues,
            within both the political community and society as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2017, The Economist ranked the Netherlands as the 11th most democratic country in the world. The monarch
            is the head of state, at present <b>King Willem-Alexander</b> of the Netherlands. Constitutionally, the position is
            equipped with limited powers. By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on
            government affairs.
